"""
This module provides classes for training Izhikevich neural networks.

The module implements training procedures for networks of Izhikevich neurons,
using various learning mechanisms from the learning module. It supports both
CPU (using NumPy) and GPU (using CuPy) implementations.

The main class is IzhNetTrainer, which provides methods for training and
evaluating Izhikevich networks. The training can use different learning
mechanisms, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and the
Brader method, which is a form of synaptic plasticity that assumes all
excitatory synapses take one of two values (binary weights).

    """
    Base class for training Izhikevich Networks.

    This class provides methods for training and evaluating Izhikevich neural networks
    using various learning mechanisms. It supports both CPU and GPU implementations,
    and can work with different types of learning mechanisms from the learning module.

    The trainer uses a learning mechanism to update the weights of the connections
    in the network during training. Two main types of learning mechanisms are supported:

    1. SimpleSTDP: A standard implementation of spike-timing-dependent plasticity,
       where the weight changes depend on the relative timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes.

    2. BraderSTDP: An implementation of the Brader method, which is a form of synaptic
       plasticity that assumes all excitatory synapses take one of two values (binary weights).
       This method comes from a paper by Brader et al. and is useful for certain types of
       learning tasks where binary decision boundaries are appropriate.

    The trainer can be used with any IzhNet instance and compatible learning mechanism.

    def __init__(self, network: net.IzhNet, learning_mechanism: ln.LearningMechanism):
        """
        Initialize the trainer with a network and learning mechanism.

        This method sets up the trainer with the specified network and learning mechanism.
        The network must be an instance of IzhNet or one of its subclasses, and the
        learning mechanism must be an instance of a concrete subclass of LearningMechanism
        (such as SimpleSTDP or BraderSTDP).

        The learning mechanism is responsible for updating the weights of the connections
        in the network during training. Different learning mechanisms implement different
        forms of synaptic plasticity, such as standard STDP or the Brader method.

        Args:
            network: The IzhNet instance to train. This can be any type of Izhikevich
                    network, such as SimpleNetwork, BraderNet, or BoolNet.

        Train the network on the given inputs and targets.

        This method trains the network using the specified inputs and targets for the
        specified number of epochs. For each epoch, it processes all input-target pairs,
        runs the network with the input, updates the weights using the learning mechanism,
        and calculates the loss.

        The method requires a valid learning mechanism (a concrete subclass of LearningMechanism,
        such as SimpleSTDP or BraderSTDP) to be provided during initialization. The learning
        mechanism is responsible for updating the weights of the connections in the network
        based on the network's activity.

        If using the BraderSTDP learning mechanism, the weight updates will follow the Brader
        method, which assumes all excitatory synapses take one of two values (binary weights).
        This is in contrast to SimpleSTDP, which allows for continuous weight values.

        Args:
            inputs: Input data for training. The format depends on the network architecture,
                   but typically this would be a list or array of input patterns.
            targets: Target outputs for training. The format depends on the network architecture,
                    but typically this would be a list or array of target patterns.
            epochs: Number of training epochs. Default is 1.
            learning_rate: Learning rate for training. This parameter may be used by the
                          learning mechanism to scale the weight updates. Default is 0.01.
